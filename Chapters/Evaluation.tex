\chapter{Evaluation}
This chapter details how the knowledge graph is evaluated upon completion and measures implementation success. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used during this section to provide a comprehensive evaluation.

\section{Requirements-Based Assessment}
\hspace{0.5cm} Assessing whether the requirements listed in the \textit{Requirements} chapter were achieved is important to measure success of implementation. For each requirement, a description stating whether it was achieved will be provided.

\section{Knowledge Graph Quality Assessment}
\hspace{0.5cm} Assessment of knowledge graph quality is important to ensure the produced knowledge graph is valid and correct. Using \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook} as guidance to assess knowledge graph quality as well as the 18 qualitative requirements detailed in \cite{evaluationpaper}. For each attribute, specific details are assessed with explanations and evaluation of knowledge graph quality. 

The three main areas used to assess knowledge graph quality are: 

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em 
    \item Accuracy
    \vspace{-0.15cm}
    \item Coverage
    \vspace{-0.15cm}
    \item Succinctness
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.1cm}

Five randomly selected knowledge graphs will be used to measure overall quality. Organs to be tested from the dataset are: \textit{Part14\_000Brouwershaven}, \textit{Part14\_000Niezijl}, \textit{Part14\_000Folsgare}, \textit{Part14\_000GravenhageNoorderkerk} and \textit{Part14\_000Groede}. All produced knowledge graphs are in the \textit{Appendix Listing A.1 to A.5}. For simplicity, a random sample of five was selected from the list of organ codes and the produced organ knowledge graphs will represent overall quality. Generating the knowledge graphs and assessing quality from the output files was the method employed. 

\subsection{Accuracy}
\hspace{0.5cm} ``Accuracy refers to the extent to which entities and relations- encoded by nodes and edges in the graph- correctly represent real-life phenomena". \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}. In this context, accuracy means the knowledge graph generated (both subjects and relationships) needs to correctly reflect the relationships between organ topics. 

There are three types of accuracy: 

\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em 
\item Syntactic Accuracy.
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\item Semantic Accuracy.
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\item Timeliness.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.4cm}

\subsubsection{Syntactic Accuracy}
\hspace{0.5cm} Syntactic accuracy refers to whether the data presented is valid for its given type \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}.

\noindent An example of a potential violation: 
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{``This is an organ" would be incompatible with xsd:integer.}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture} [
        square/.style={draw=yellow, rectangle, ultra thick, fill=yellow!30},
        align=center,
        node distance=5cm ]
    \node[square] (q1)  {Organ};
    \node[square, right of=q1] (q2)  {"This is an organ"};
        \draw (q1) edge[above] node {\tt xsd:integer} (q2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.6cm}
\caption{Syntactic Accuracy Violation}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.15cm}

Upon assessing the produced knowledge graphs for each of the five organ knowledge graphs, no syntactic inaccuracies were found. Since the ontology was created using the provided ontology and external links, the resulting knowledge graphs are theoretically free from any syntactic inaccuracies.

\subsubsection{Semantic Accuracy}
\hspace{0.5cm} Semantic accuracy refers to whether data values are being correctly represented in a real-world context \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}.

\noindent An example of a potential violation: 
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{Date of build (for an organ) coming after today's date.}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture} [
        square/.style={draw=yellow, rectangle, ultra thick, fill=yellow!30},
        align=center,
        node distance=5cm ]
    \node[square] (q1)  {Organ};
    \node[square, right of=q1] (q2)  {"2055-01-01"};
        \draw (q1) edge[above] node {\tt oont:buildDate} (q2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.6cm}
\caption{Semantic Accuracy Violation}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.15cm}

In regards to semantic accuracy, none of the five organs contained semantic inaccuracies upon assessment. This can be explained for similar reasons as above regarding the absence of syntactic inaccuracies. 

\subsubsection{Timeliness}
\hspace{0.5cm} Timeliness refers to how up-to-date or relevant the knowledge graph is with the current state of the modern world \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}. This is also in line with \cite{evaluationpaper} stating that ``Knowledge graphs should contain the latest resources to guarantee freshness".

\noindent An example of a potential violation:
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{Organ's location stated as ``Netherlands", but has recently been moved to ``Portugal" and the knowledge graph has not been updated.}
\end{displayquote}

In the produced knowledge graphs, violations of timeliness can occur due to the static nature of the dataset. An example of a violation may occur when the \textit{?disposition} is no longer the organ's current disposition in real life, but data in the dataset is not up-to-date. Therefore, the knowledge graph produced, in this case, will output an untimely solution. This particular violation will occur over time as the organ's divisions can change over time. However, at the current moment in time, no timeliness violations occur in the five produced knowledge graphs.

\subsection{Coverage}
\hspace{0.5cm} ``Coverage refers to avoiding the omission of domain-relevant elements, which may yield incomplete results" \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}. In this context, the knowledge graph must completely fill the ontology framework in all of its nodes and edges. This is to accurately represent the entire dataset given. 

\noindent There are two types of coverage: 

\vspace{-0.15cm}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item Completeness.
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\item Representativeness.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.4cm}

\subsubsection{Completeness}
\hspace{0.5cm} Completeness ensures the knowledge graph is correctly filled with all the relevant information present in a particular dataset \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}. Adding contextual information about entities and from different resources \cite{evaluationpaper} is also important to ensure completeness. 

\noindent Some examples of potential violations:

\vspace{-0.15cm}
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{- Organ classes lacking information.}
\end{displayquote}
\vspace{-0.6cm}
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{- Important values missing for a specific organ property.}
\end{displayquote}
\vspace{-0.1cm}

With regard to dataset coverage, most of the data is represented in the knowledge graph. Reasoning for the omission of some data is related to how it can be represented in the knowledge graph without causing confusion. For example, the specific ranges of a given organ for each keyboard or pedal are omitted due to the possible confusion it may cause when representing the keyboard and pedal ranges (\textit{?range1} and \textit{?range2}). Also, representing all that data concisely would be challenging and it may be seen as unnecessary. However, this is only relevant to some data. 

Contextual information is added in the form of descriptions and custom links in all assessed knowledge graphs. The relationship \textit{oont:extraInformation}, for instance, provides context and extra detail for a specific node. 

Different resources can be seen in the five knowledge graphs such as Wikidata links, data from the dataset and various other website links. 

\subsubsection{Representativeness}
\hspace{0.5cm} Representativeness ensures the knowledge graph does not involve any bias and does not exclude anything relevant \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}.

\noindent Some examples of potential violations: 

\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{- Under-represent organ data from other languages.}
\end{displayquote}  
\vspace{-0.6cm}
\begin{displayquote}
     \textit{- Under-represent people (e.g. organist, owner) from a particular gender, race etc. }  
\end{displayquote}
\vspace{-0.1cm}

Violations regarding under-representation stem from the dataset provided. For example, the dataset is written in Dutch so organ data is limited to the Dutch language. With regard to the under-representation of people, anyone involved with the organ is mentioned in all five knowledge graphs such as: \textit{?maintainer} and \textit{?builder} so no violations occur in that regard.

\subsection{Succinctness}
\hspace{0.5cm} ``Succinctness refers to the inclusion of relevant content that is represented in a concise and intelligible manner" \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}. In this context, it means the knowledge graph created should be easily understandable and to the point. 

\noindent There are two types of succinctness: 

\vspace{-0.15cm}
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em 
\item Representational Conciseness.
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\item Understandability.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.4cm}

\subsubsection{Representational Conciseness}
\hspace{0.5cm} Representational conciseness refers to the extent in which knowledge graph content is compactly represented \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}. This is consistent with requirements from \cite{evaluationpaper}, particularly: ``triples should be concise" and ``knowledge graph does not contain redundant triples".

\noindent An example of a potential violation: 
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{Containing two properties that serve the same purpose i.e.}
\end{displayquote}
\vspace{-0.65cm}
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{- Organist}
\end{displayquote}
\vspace{-0.825cm}
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{- Organ Player}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture} [
        square/.style={draw=yellow, rectangle, ultra thick, fill=yellow!30},
        align=center,
        node distance=5cm ]
    \node[square] (q1)  {Organist};
    \node[square, right of=q1] (q2)  {Organ Player};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\caption{Representational Conciseness Violation}
\end{figure}

Each knowledge graph is created with the purpose of making them concise. Creation of the ontology structure was derived and refined from the provided ontology. \textit{Figure 7.2} in the design was made specifically to represent the data in a concise manner and avoid the inclusion of redundant data. Implementation also kept this in mind when refining the ontology. Upon assessing each of the five organs, the produced knowledge graphs are representationally concise content.

\subsubsection{Understandability}
\hspace{0.5cm} Understandability refers to the need for readability and ease of understanding the knowledge graph generated \cite{knowledgegraphevaulationbook}.

\noindent An example of a potential violation: 
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{Using property names such as Organist1, when asked to state the name of an organist (Actual name should be used instead).}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture} [
        square/.style={draw=yellow, rectangle, ultra thick, fill=yellow!30},
        align=center,
        node distance=5cm ]
    \node[square] (q1)  {Organist1};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\caption{Understandability Violation}
\end{figure}

Data in the dataset is understandable from the perspective of a Dutch reader. Given the relationships, the meaning of data can be easily inferred. However, there are some cases in the produced knowledge graphs where nodes produce an empty string ``" due to empty data in the dataset. For example, the variable \textit{?partition} in the ontology is often empty and, out of the five tested organs, four of the \textit{partition}'s data is missing. However, important nodes such as \textit{?disposition}, which were integral to the understanding of other data in the knowledge graph, were replaced with other strings to reduce confusion. 

From a lay user's perspective, it could also be argued that the displayed Wikidata information can seem confusing at first glance due to only the codes being displayed. However, this can be mitigated by physically clicking the URI link while viewing these external Wikidata links. 

To accurately measure understandability, a survey was carried out consisting of various competency questions for a given knowledge graph in \textit{Appendix Listing A.6}. Assessing participants' ability to answer these questions gave an accurate representation of how understandable the knowledge graph was. However, this may be hindered by the knowledge graph presented to participants being translated from Dutch to English, which was necessary as most people were predominantly English speakers. The competency questions, themselves, were derived from the provided organ ontology's GitHub page. Not all questions on this page were used to reduce time completion and encourage participation in the survey. Questions used in the survey were:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Who built the organ?
    \vspace{-0.25cm}
    \item Where are the original parts of the organ?
    \vspace{-0.25cm}
    \item Where is the organ originally located?
    \vspace{-0.25cm}
    \item When is the organ moved to another location?
    \vspace{-0.25cm}
    \item Why is the organ moved to another location? 
    \vspace{-0.25cm}
    \item Any additional comments?
\end{enumerate}

All ten participants consisted of those with a Computer Science background and were knowledgeable of Semantic Web's technologies, which consisted mainly of second or third-year Computer Science University students at King's College London. One participant was a native Dutch speaker and completed the task using the original knowledge graph as they were able to understand it. Users of this knowledge graph are part of the Polifonia project so are knowledgeable in this field. Therefore, sampling users from a Computer Science background is a fair representation of a potential user's capability. Ensuring this particular set of users could understand the knowledge graph, was vital. 

Surveys were conducted using Google Forms and shared with all eligible participants in \textit{Appendix Figure A.1}. Answers to each question on the survey were usually either correct or incorrect, as they were readily available on the knowledge graph. Specifically, the form consisted of competency questions as well as the possibility to add any comments. The knowledge graph was sent as part of the survey invitation in a separate file. Number of participants with correct answers for each question is plotted below: 

\pgfplotsset{compat=1.18}

    axis y line*=left,
    tickwidth=3.5pt,

    ylabel= \textit{No. Correct Responses}, 
    symbolic x coords = {Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4,Q5},
]
\addplot coordinates {
    (Q1,8)

    (Q4,8)
    (Q5,5)
};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.8cm}
\caption{Correct Competency Question Responses}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-0.15cm}

The bar chart \textit{Figure 9.3} plots the number of correct responses per question. In general, the produced knowledge graph was well understood by participants and were mostly able to get the correct answer to the competency question. This provides evidence of understandability although the last competency question received equivocal responses, proving the produced knowledge graph is not perfect. 

When asking for comments regarding the knowledge graph (Q6), they showed a common theme of confusion surrounding the musical aspects, which may have impacted results. 

\section{Query Scalability Assessment}
In this section, scalability of the knowledge graph will be tested. In particular, the areas being measured to assist quantification of the knowledge graph scalability are: 

\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0cm
    \item Number of SERVICE Calls.
    \vspace{-0.1cm}
    \item Size of Files.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.1cm}

For each one, measurement of scalability will be computed using the time required to execute the query on command line, which is how long it takes to generate the knowledge graph. This will make use of a command on the Windows OS called: \textit{Measure-Command} \cite{measurecommand}, which measures the time required for a command to execute. For instance, measuring the time required to generate a knowledge graph for organ: \textit{Part01\_001MIDDE} is:

\lstset
{
    breaklines=true,
    breakatwhitespace=true,
    basicstyle=\linespread{1.5}\ttfamily,
}
\begin{lstlisting}
    Measure-Command{java -jar sparql-anything-0.8.1.jar -q queries/organ-details.sparql --values organ=Part01_001MIDDE -o output/output.ttl}
\end{lstlisting}

The same sample of five organs will be selected for knowledge graph generation and tests will be run on a 64-bit OS with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8265U CPU @ 1.60GHz 1.80 GHz and 8GB RAM. Regarding time calculation, the procedure will involve running each of the five sampled organs ten times using \textit{Measure-Command}, followed by calculation of the average time per organ. Finally, the mean times for all five organs will be noted.

\subsection{Size of Dataset}
\hspace{0.5cm} For this test, knowledge graph generation time was calculated with respect to dataset size, which was accomplished through the removal of data in the JSON files. The five tested organs, however, will always remain in the files. This is possible since the structure of each JSON file follows the same format as shown in the \textit{Context} chapter. External links were left in the query as their addition did not significantly affect results. After systematically removing organs from each JSON file to measure size, the actual size of a file will be noted using a VS Code extension: \textit{filesize} and the dataset's total size will be calculated. A graph plotted with cumulative file sizes against time can be seen in \textit{Figure 9.4}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis x line=bottom,
    axis y line=left,
    xlabel=\textit{file size (MiB)},
    ylabel=\textit{time (ms)}, ]
\addplot[smooth,blue] plot coordinates {
    (0.01,1353.7575)
    (7.498502, 1751.012)
    (11.9024, 2021.9029)
    (15.27645, 2213.0641)
    (21.8746, 2464.1894)
};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\caption{Analysis of Dataset Size}
\end{figure}

\textit{Figure 9.4} shows an initial linear relationship between the dataset's size and time. This shows that the knowledge graph-generating query produced is scalable to a certain extent. It is unknown, however, how well the query will perform for much larger dataset sizes. 

Measurement of much larger input values was done in \cite{sparqlanything} and showed an exponential relationship between execution time and input size. However, the findings in relation to our input size are consistent as the paper does show a linear relationship in the smaller input sizes. Therefore, is not a problem for the scope of our generated knowledge graph. Nevertheless, extremely large input sizes may pose a potential issue scalability-wise in the future.

\subsection{Number of SERVICE Calls}
\hspace{0.5cm} In this test, number of SERVICE calls within the query are tested to observe their effect on the speed of knowledge graph generation. In the implemented query, removal of SERVICE calls will be done incrementally and plotted against execution time. Measuring the number of SERVICE calls will indicate the scalability of the knowledge graph, providing insight into its capacity for expansion.

For this project, knowledge graph size will increase proportionally with the number of SERVICE calls. A mock knowledge graph was created using additional SERVICE calls that were not in the project scope and added for testing purposes to measure expandability. Data gathered from the SERVICE call was added to the mock knowledge graph. This was to account for the genuine overhead when adding data onto the knowledge graph during command execution. In this particular test, all external links in the knowledge graph were removed so as to not affect execution time. The plotted graph for number of SERVICE calls against time can be seen in \textit{Figure 9.5}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis x line=bottom,
    axis y line=left,
    xlabel=\textit{no. SERVICE calls},
    ylabel=\textit{time (ms)}, 
    ]
\addplot[smooth,blue] plot coordinates {
    (1, 1184.163)
    (10, 1318.7934)
    (20, 1730.7290)
    (29, 1975.1539)
    (39, 2143.491)
    (49, 2340.4259)
    (59, 2520.7234)
    (99, 3420.7116)
};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\caption{Analysis of SERVICE Calls}
\end{figure}

After plotting the graph (\textit{Figure 9.5}) of up to 100 SERVICE calls, an initial linear relationship can be seen between variables. The expandability of the knowledge graph is possible within reason. However, this graph only plots values for up to 100 SERVICE calls so time required for extremely large amounts of SERVICE calls may differ.

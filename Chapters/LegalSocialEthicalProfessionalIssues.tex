\chapter{Legal, Social, Ethical \& Professional Issues} 
In this chapter, legal, social, ethical and professional concerns surrounding the project will be discussed. The project adhered to both the Code of Conduct issued by the British Computer Society \cite{bcs} and the FAIR Principles \cite{fairprinciples} outlined in an article discussing the reuse of scholarly data.

\section{Code of Conduct}
\hspace{0.5cm} The project acts in public interest as it enhances knowledge discovery through the creation of a knowledge graph, providing a broader understanding of organs. All external resources used are open-source and allow for the use of data. In particular, Wikidata's license states that it is dedicated to the public domain and has no copyright. MusicBrainz license allows for adaption provided that credit is given. Consent has been permitted from both external sources and credit has also been given. The project aims to provide anyone from any background with a means of viewing musical heritage data on the WWW. The Polifonia project, itself, involves people from many different fields so it enables multi-disciplinary collaboration.  

The project adheres to professional competence and integrity due to the knowledge gained from various sources of information such as those stated in the \textit{Literature Review} section of the report. Throughout the report, documentation and reasoning for actions are explained with appropriate citations where necessary to ensure academic integrity. Feedback throughout the project from the supervisor Dr Albert Mero{\~n}o-Pe{\~n}uela was kindly accepted whether it be constructive criticism or project advice. Enabling consideration of alternate viewpoints and seeking valuable support for the work. 

Relevant authorities understand the project being undertaken as part of the Polifonia project. Communication with the supervisor has allowed for a smooth process and for full transparency for the project's duration. Definition of intellectual data such as the dataset was made explicit throughout the project to ensure that data ownership was clearly defined.

Duty to the profession was considered throughout the project. \textit{Requirement}, \textit{Specification} and \textit{Design} sections dedicated to development of the project were similar to methods used in software development. A professional relationship was kept with all those who assisted in the project's evolution to ensure respect and integrity. Mention of other tools for this project demonstrated continuous professional development by acknowledging all available technologies at my disposal and carefully selecting the most suitable option. 

However, following the process in which the knowledge graph was generated in this project to create a malicious knowledge graph is possible so distribution of this report needs to be done carefully. Also, produced knowledge graphs being in Dutch may feel some users to be excluded or bias may be introduced from a Dutch perspective. 

\section{FAIR Principles}
\hspace{0.5cm} The acronym FAIR stands for: \textbf{F}indable, \textbf{A}ccessible, \textbf{I}nteroperable and \textbf{R}eusable. The article \cite{fairprinciples} was written by a diverse set of publishers to promote the sharing and reuse of research data. 

\subsection{Findable}
\hspace{0.5cm} This ensures resources used are easy to find. The project's provided resources are all publicly searchable as part of the Polifonia project, which includes the dataset and ontology. Work completed independently is in a public GitHub repository and can be found by anyone. 

\subsection{Accessible}
\hspace{0.5cm} This ensures resources are available and can be accessed with ease. The project is stored in a public GitHub repository with no restraints as are the provided ontology and dataset. Any lay user can use the resources as they wish. A user guide has also been provided to help any user to execute the project. 

\subsection{Interoperable}
\hspace{0.5cm} This ensures resources are flexible and can integrate with others. The project has been integrated with other external resources so further expansion is very possible. Standard formats such as RDF are also used to facilitate integration with other resources. The tool SPARQL Anything was also used as it is publicly available so others can also use this tool. 

\subsection{Reusable}
\hspace{0.5cm} This ensures resources can be used in different contexts. Although the created ontology has been refined for the project's goals, it may be reused along with the query. This report also provides ample detail for project replication if anyone wishes to do so and involves a reference list for further details on sources.

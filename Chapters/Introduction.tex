\chapter{Introduction}
This first chapter will introduce the rationale and scope for the project.

\section{Rationale}
There are many information sources today that are still not computationally represented or explored fully on the WWW. Therefore, there is demand for a means to represent this information possibly in the form of knowledge graphs, so vast amounts of data on the web can be available to use computationally or by anyone. Finding an automated way to generate knowledge graphs from structured data or text found on the web is vital to addressing this demand. Current solutions to generating knowledge graphs include: SPARQL-Generate \cite{sparqlgenerate}, RML \cite{rml} and ChatGPT \cite{chatgptwebsite}. However, these tools are limited by their scope and complexity to reach the solution, so selecting SPARQL-Anything \cite{sparqlanythinggithub} for implementation was most favourable. 

Generating knowledge graphs directly from datasets is not trivial as the process is complex and requires an understanding of knowledge engineering. Knowledge engineering, itself, requires experience and research in areas such as: what ontologies to use or create, what vocabularies to use and what classes to use. So the process of generating knowledge graphs from a dataset is not instantaneous and requires extensive research. In the case of smaller knowledge graphs, it is possible to manually create knowledge graphs without the use of a tool. Nonetheless, physically building the knowledge graph triple by triple would be time-consuming and is prone to human error, especially for larger knowledge graphs and datasets. This approach is also not sustainable. 

The aim of this project is to use SPARQL Anything and a given dataset to create a knowledge graph. Integration of various sources of data into a single, encapsulated knowledge graph can enable the sharing and understandability of this information by both humans and machines. Knowledge graphs may provide economic advantages by reducing the time and effort to analyse vast amounts of data. Consumers may use the knowledge graphs for their own needs or follow the process detailed in the report to create their own knowledge graphs.

\section{Scope}
The project is part of the Polifonia project, which seeks to create an ecosystem of computational tools and methodologies to spread knowledge about musical history on the internet \cite{polifoniaproject}. Therefore, this report assists the Polifonia project in achieving its objectives and facilitates its progress. This designated project involves a dataset centred around organs so the report includes a breakdown of the various organ components as well as background information regarding technical knowledge.

This project will detail the process of knowledge graph generation using an organ-orientated dataset and provided ontology, both of which were contextualised to fully understand the dataset and to refine the existing ontology. In order to commence, knowledge of the semantic web and its capabilities was required so as to understand the scope of the project. Researching and being able to interpret RDF, ontologies and knowledge graphs was required to reach the solution as well as interpret it. 

The following chapters provide a comprehensive view of the design and implementation process for generating knowledge graphs. The design chapter complements the implementation phase by using visual tools and careful planning. Subsequently, the implementation chapter meticulously explains the steps required to reach the final solution. A thorough evaluation of the produced knowledge graph is performed with both qualitative and quantitative forms of assessment being carried out. The legal, social, ethical and professional issues surrounding this project are also reviewed to adhere to the Code of Conduct \& Code of Good Practice issued by the British Computer Society \cite{bcs} as well as the FAIR Principles \cite{fairprinciples}. This is also intended to assist in identifying any potential issues that may arise for the duration of the project.

Finally, the conclusion will summarise work completed during the course of this project and include a discussion on future work and limitations.

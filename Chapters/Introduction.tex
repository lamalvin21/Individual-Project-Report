\chapter{Introduction}
There are many information sources today there are still not computationally represented or explored fully on the web. Therefore, there is demand for a means to represent this information in the form of knowledge graphs, so the vast amounts of data on the web can be available to use by anyone. Finding an automated way to generate knowledge graphs from structured data or text found on the web is vital to addressing this demand. Current solutions to generating knowledge graphs include: SPARQL-Generate \cite{sparqlgenerate}, RML \cite{rml} and ChatGPT \cite{chatgptwebsite}. However, these tools are limited by their scope and complexity to reach the solution, so selecting SPARQL-Anything \cite{sparqlanythinggithub} for implementation was most favourable. 

Generating knowledge graphs directly from datasets is not trivial as the process is complex and requires understanding of knowledge engineering. Knowledge engineering requires experience and research on areas such as what ontologies to use or create, what vocabularies to use and what classes to use. So the process of generating knowledge graphs from a dataset is not instantaneous and requires research. In the case of smaller knowledge graphs, it is possible to manually create knowledge graphs without the use of a tool. Nevertheless, physically building the knowledge graph triple by triple would take a lot of time and is prone to human error for larger knowledge graphs and datasets. 

This project will detail the process of knowledge graphs generation using a organ orientated dataset and provided ontology, which will be implemented using SPARQL-Anything. In order to start the project, knowledge of the semantic web and it's capabilities was required so to understand the scope of the project. Researching and being able to interpret RDF, ontologies and knowledge graphs is required to reach the solution as well as interpret it. 

The project is part of the Polifonia project, which seeks to create an ecosystem of computational tools and methodologies to spread knowledge about musical history on the internet \cite{polifoniaproject}. My designated project required a dataset centred around organs so the report includes background information as well as a breakdown of the various organ components.

Step-by-step instructions on how to execute the knowledge graph generation query will be detailed below:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Download project zip file in GitHub repository: \\ https://github.com/lamalvin21/ThirdYearProject
    \item Unzip the file.
    \item Download sparql-anything-0.8.1.jar file from \\ https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/sparql.anything/releases
    \item Install appropriate Java Development Kit based on Operating System ensuring java works on command line: \\ https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
    \item Place the SPARQL Anything .jar executable inside the project file. The .jar executable should be in the same directory as the \textit{output} and \textit{queries} folders. 
    \item Navigate to the correct directory on command line (wherever project is stored) and execute a query to test: \\

    \lstset
    {
        breaklines=true,
        breakatwhitespace=false,
        basicstyle=\linespread{1}\ttfamily,
    }
    \begin{lstlisting}
    java -jar sparql-anything-0.8.1.jar -q queries/organ-details.sparql --values organ=Part01_001MIDDE -o output/output.ttl
    \end{lstlisting}
    \vspace{-0.25cm}
        \item Resulting knowledge graph should be in the output folder and in a file called output.ttl in this example.
        \item Try passing in different organs, which can be found in the organid.json file.
\end{enumerate}

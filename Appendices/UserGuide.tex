\lstset
{
    breaklines=true,
    breakatwhitespace=false,
    basicstyle=\linespread{1}\ttfamily,
}
\begin{lstlisting}
java -jar sparql-anything-0.8.1.jar -q queries/organ-details.sparql --values organ=Part01_001MIDDE -o output/output.ttl
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
    \item Resulting knowledge graph should be in the output folder and in a file called output.ttl
    \item Try passing in different organs, which can be found in the organid.json file.
\end{enumerate}

% The guide should provide easily understood instructions on how to use your software. A particularly useful approach is to treat the user guide as a walk-through of a typical session, or set of sessions, which collectively display all of the features of your package. The extensive use of diagrams, illustrating the package in action, can often be particularly helpful.

Increasing internet use has led to vast amounts of internet resources on the World Wide Web (WWW), but symbolic representation of this data is currently limited. This project aims to fill this void by applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to represent musical heritage data on the WWW. In particular, this project will use the tool SPARQL Anything to generate a knowledge graph, following an ontology. The knowledge graph will represent data from an organ dataset and be expanded upon by incorporating external resources. Moreover, this report details the process of knowledge graph generation, which can be applied in other contexts. Upon evaluation, the produced knowledge graph was found to be high quality, easily interpretable and scalable, but there is still room for improvement. Extensions of this project could include use of external datasets and data sources to broaden the knowledge graph.

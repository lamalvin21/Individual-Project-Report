The rise of the internet has led to many internet resources on the World Wide Web and computational representation of this data is currently limited. This project aims to represent musical heritage data by applying AI. In particular, this project will use a tool (SPARQL-Anything) to generate a knowledge graph, following an ontology, that represents data from an organ dataset and by using external resources. The produced knowledge graph must be high-quality, easily interpretable and scalable. Extensions of this project include use of external datasets and data sources to further expand the knowledge graph.

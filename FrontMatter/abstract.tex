This project aims to create an expansive knowledge graph through the use of a tool called SPARQL Anything. The dataset centers on organs, the musical instrument, and SPARQL  Anything will be used to query it and form an appropriate knowledge graph. The knowledge graph, itself, will include data from the Organ dataset as well as data from external website datasets in order to expand and support the knowledge graph being created. 

The main goal of this project is to transform the organ dataset into an expansive knowledge graph and the process will be detailed in this report.

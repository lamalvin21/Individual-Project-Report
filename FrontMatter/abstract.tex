This project aims to create an expansive knowledge graph through the use of a tool called SPARQL Anything. The dataset revolves around the musical instrument: Organs and the query I am going to create in SPARQL Anything will allow me to query this dataset and, subsequently, create a knowledge graph from it. The knowledge graph, itself, will include data from the Organ dataset as well as data from external website datasets in order to expand the knowledge graph being created. 

The main goal of this project is to transform the organ dataset into an expansive knowledge graph and the process will be detailed in this report.
